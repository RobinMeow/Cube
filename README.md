# Cube
Play as a `CubeShooter` and shoot cubes (`Projectile`s) to destroy other `CubeShooter`s. 
Optionally player against yourself. The Shadow-`CubeShooter` mimics your movement. Shooting the Shadow, means the shadow shoots you! 

Multiplayer: WIP

You cannot move on the ground.  
You can tap the `Jump`-Button or hold it to jump significantly higher.  
You can tap the `Shoot`-Button or hold it to shoot further, and the `Projectile` will be significantly faster. 
You can aim via the Mouse, or using a Gamepag Stick.
